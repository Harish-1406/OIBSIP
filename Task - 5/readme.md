# ðŸ“Š Sales Prediction using Machine Learning
## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project aims to predict future sales based on historical data using machine learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation to estimate sales accurately.

## ðŸš€ Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Implementation of regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Model performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE and RÂ²

Sales prediction for given input features

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

Visualizations show key factors influencing sales.

The model provides accurate predictions with optimized parameters.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements

Integrate deep learning models for improved accuracy

Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit

Automate data updates for real-time predictions
